<p align="justify">Sheremetievo is the second largest airport in Europe in terms of passenger traffic per year.

<p align="justify">Passengers departing from the airport have significant consumer activity, which is currently not analyzed deeply enough. Forecasting the activity of passengers depending on the direction of their departure and the time spent in the "clean zone" will help the airport to adjust plans for the development of the route network and infrastructure, and plan outcome of local outlets.

<p align="justify">The concept of predicting revenues in Sheremetievo airport retail outlets based on real revenue in May 2022 and passenger traffic-related features was developed earlier with ML technique: https://github.com/roman-permyakov/Sheremetievo

<p align="justify">This App is designed to display revenue forecasts of Sheremetievo airport retail outlets more clearly and visually precisely with Streamlit dashboard.</p>
